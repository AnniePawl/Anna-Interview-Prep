# Given an odd positive integer n, produce a two-dimensional array of size n×n. Fill each element with the character "." . Then fill the middle row, the middle column and the diagonals with the character "*".  You'll get an image of a snow flake. Print the snow flake in n×n rows and columns and separate the characters with a single space.

def snowflake(n):
  pass 

print(snowflake(7))
