## Understand

Clarify what interviewer is asking for <br>

- What is the prompt?
- What key actions do we need to take within prompt?
- What is the input?
- What data type is input?
- What is the output, exactly?

## Match

Identify similar patterns and problems

- Have I seen a problem like this before?
- What kinds of operations are involved?

## Plan

Psudeocode an algorithm to prove it works

- Determine the answer by creating short test cases
- Pick an n that is small enough , but not 1 or 2
- Draw a diagram, manually perform steps
- Talk out loud about your decisions
- Solve the smallest, most relevant problem
- Write steps you took to determine answer
- Perform steps for larger n value
  **Planning Example:**<br>

```
given an input number
for every number under the input number
  check to see if the number is prime
  if it is, mark it as prime
  if it isn't, mark it as not prime
return the count of the prime numbers
```

## Implement

Write the code

- Use pseudo code to guide you

## Review

Test solution, waslk thru it mentally

## Evaluate
