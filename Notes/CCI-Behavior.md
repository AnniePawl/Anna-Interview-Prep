# Behavioral Interview Notes 

## The Interview Process 
It's all relative. An interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other candidates. Not black and white, but evaluated on all of the following: 
### Analytical Skills
- How much help do you need solving the problem?
- How optimal is your solution?
- How long did it take to arrive at solution?
### Coding Skills
- Did you successfully traslate algorithm to code?
- Was code clean and well organized?
- Did you consider potential errors?
- Did you use good style?
### Technical Knowledge 
- Do you know your CS fundamentals?
- Are you familiar with relevant technologies?
### Experience 
- Have you made good tech decisions in the past?
- What cool and challenging projects have you built?
- Do you show drive, initiative, etc?
### Culture Fit / Communication
- Do your personality and values match with team and company?
- Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

## Hard questions, not hard knowledge
Goal is to evaluate problem-solving skills.x

## Behind the Scenes 
Most companies conduct their interviews in similar ways. Feedback not always provided. Decisions usually made within a week. Companies might have specific values like passion for technology or scalability. </br>
**Screening:** Usually conducted over the phone. Often involves coding and algorithm questions. </br>
**Homework:** Some companies give take home assignments. </br>
**On-site:** Typically have 3 to 6 in-person interviews. One is often non-technical and over lunch to get a sense of cultural fit.
