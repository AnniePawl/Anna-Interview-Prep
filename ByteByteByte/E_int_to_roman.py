# Given an integer, write a function that returns its roman numeral representation




def int_to_roman(int):
  pass 

prnt(int_to_roman(1)) "I"
prnt(int_to_roman(5)) "IV"
prnt(int_to_roman(49)) "XLIX"
The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
