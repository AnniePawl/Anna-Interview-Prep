# Given an array of nums, find out how many num are smaller than each num in array. 

# COMMUNICATION STEPS 
# Restate problem: For number at each index in array, return the count of how many numbers in array are less than it
# Clarifying questions: Do duplicates count as 1 num or seperate num? Is array in order? Are nums integers? Are there negative values?
# Assumptions: nums might be ints, floats, or negative. nums might unsorted, duplicates will count as seperate nums


def smaller_nums(nums):
  output = []
  for num in nums:
    for j in 

  

print(smaller_nums([8,1,2,2,3])) # [4,0,1,1,3]
